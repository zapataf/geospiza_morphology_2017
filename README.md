# Introduction

This repository contains the code and data of the analyses presented in:

    Cadena CD, Jiménez I, Zapata F. Atlantean evolution in Darwin’s finches: 
    Issues in species delimitation using phenotypic data.


# Dependencies

The scripts require R and several libraries. See `analysis.r` for details.

The code presented here is written using the `tidyverse` syntax. To learn more about tidyverse, we stronlgy recommend this excellent resource: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz). We also provide the same code for all analyses in Base R as supplementary online material to our paper. 

# Data

The `data/` directory contains morphological measurements from H. S. Swarth's archive available at the [California Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org). We sincerely thank [Jack Dumbacher](http://www.jackdumbacher.com) for allowing us to use and publish these morphological data, and to Bailey McKay who kindly provided tabulated data.
