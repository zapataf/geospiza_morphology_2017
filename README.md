# Introduction

This repository contains the code and data of the analyses presented in:

    Cadena CD, Jiménez I, Zapata F. 2017. Atlantean evolution in Darwin’s finches: 
    Issues and perspectives in species delimitation using phenotypic data. bioRxiv 
    http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/06/124610


# Dependencies

The scripts require R and several libraries. See `analysis.r` for details.

The code presented here is written using largely the `tidyverse` syntax. To learn more about tidyverse, we recommend this resource: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz). We also provide the same code for all analyses in `Base R` as supplementary online material to our manuscript. Both versions of the code do **exactly** the same.

# Data

The `CAS_Swarth_Geospiza.csv` contains morphological measurements from H. S. Swarth's archive available at the [California Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org). We sincerely thank [Jack Dumbacher](http://www.jackdumbacher.com) for allowing us to use and publish these morphological data, and to Bailey McKay who kindly provided tabulated data.
